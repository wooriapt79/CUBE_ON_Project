# CUBE_ON_Project

### Writing a README...

READMEs do more than explain how to use your project. They also explain why your project matters, and what your users can do with it.

In your README, try to answer the following questions:

1.What does this project do?

2.Why is this project useful?

3.How do I get started?

4.Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can use your README to answer other questions, like how you handle contributions, what the goals of the project are, and information about licenses and attribution. If you donâ€™t want to accept contributions, or your project is not yet ready for production, write this information down.
